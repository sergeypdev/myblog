My name is Sergei Pozniak.

I'm a Software Developer with over 8 years of experience. My main area of expertise is Frontend Web Development, but I'm also passionate about game development.

I started programming when I was 13 with C#. Later I learned Lua and JavaScript, this is when I started my Frontend Development Career.

Fast forward 8 years later and I'm a Senior Frontend Developer, but I also had a chance to work as a Fullstack developer.
Meanwhile I was learning a lot about systems programming with Rust, Zig, C and C++.

Right now I'm working on some pet projects in Unreal Engine.

I created this blog to share my progress on my projects as well as anything else I find interesting/want to talk about :)
